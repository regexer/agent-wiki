# Changelog

<!-- Merge to main is the release, so version headers carry no dates: a release's date
     is derivable on demand from git (the merge commit of its version-bump PR, e.g.
     `git log --merges --date=iso-strict --format='%cd %s' -- .claude-plugin/plugin.json`),
     quoted in UTC — GitHub's merged_at and git's committer-local dates disagree across
     midnight. A stored date can't be known before the merge lands and goes stale if it
     slips. -->

## 0.2.12

### Changed

- `PROTOCOL.md` Figures: four clarifications from field application by a
  downstream adopter, each resolving a question live pages raised. (1) The
  frozen marker is normative in ELEMENTS (verb + ISO date + value co-present
  in one sentence), not word order. (2) The inputs clause is strongly
  expected but not load-bearing, and backticks within it are optional —
  frozen is exempt from machine checking, so there is no checkability to
  discriminate. (3) The pinned parenthetical and the "measured" keyword are
  the MACHINE tier; value/date/backticked-command bound in prose, or a
  synonym verb ("took 7.1 s on ..."), are conforming IN SUBSTANCE —
  agent-verifiable, machine-invisible, and reconcile's never-silently-correct
  rule follows substance, never vocabulary. (4) The taxonomy is triggered by
  the figure (the number), never the verb: a qualitative "measured" finding
  is an ordinary claim, and checkers must not flag date-absence in sentences
  carrying no figure. No linter behavior change.

## 0.2.11

### Changed

- `PROTOCOL.md` Figures: the marker forms are now pinned, requested by a
  downstream adopter building a docs-side figure checker on the wiki
  convention. Stored-with-recipe: `<value> (recipe: <command-in-backticks>,
  as of YYYY-MM-DD)`; a backticked recipe is runnable, a prose recipe is
  descriptive (agent-only) — backticks are the checkability discriminator,
  as for paths. Derive-on-demand has no marker (the backticked command
  stands where the number would); frozen keeps its sentence shape
  ("measured N on YYYY-MM-DD with `INPUTS`"), distinguished from
  stored-with-recipe by phrasing. No linter behavior change.

## 0.2.10

Ruling-7 (`dead-code-ref`) revision, from a downstream adopter's conformance
review: the reference diverged from ruling 7's own text in two places, and one
piece of existing behavior was undocumented. No new checks; a conforming wiki's
verdicts change only where a page carries out-of-spec tokens.

### Fixed

- **`..` path segments are no longer resolved against the host.** A backticked
  `../sibling/x.py` (or `docs/../../x.py`) was checked via `repo_root / ref`,
  which walks out of the repo — so the warning count depended on which sibling
  checkouts existed on the machine. Any token with a `..` path segment (segment
  equality, not substring) is now not checkable, like leading `/` and `~`.
- **Any whitespace character disqualifies a span**, not only a literal space.
  A tab or CR inside a span was previously checked as one path and produced a
  false `dead-code-ref`.

### Changed

- CONFORMANCE ruling 7 consolidated: repo-relative means no leading `/` or `~`,
  no `..` segment, no `<placeholders>`, no whitespace of any kind; resolution is
  against the working tree relative to the repo root; the `:N` / `:N-M` line
  suffix is documented as decoration — stripped and never validated (a stale
  line number is an authoring concern per PROTOCOL's Figures section, not a
  linter finding); shorthand and pattern notation (`file.ts` for `src/file.ts`,
  `{a,b}.md`) are named out of scope — out-of-spec notation is fixed in the
  page, not blessed by the linter.
- Changelog header: release dates are quoted in UTC (GitHub's `merged_at` and
  git's committer-local dates disagree across midnight).

## 0.2.9

Conformance follow-ups from port testing (found by a downstream Node port).

### Fixed

- **The CLI no longer treats a lone CR as a line terminator.** Log files are
  now read byte-preserving (`newline=""`); through 0.2.8, Python's default
  universal-newlines read translated a lone `\r` to `\n` before the checker
  ran, so the CLI reported one `log-body` error per CR-separated fragment
  while the checker itself — correctly, per CONFORMANCE ruling 1 — saw one
  line. Byte-verbatim ports were already conforming.

### Added

- `PROTOCOL.md` gains a **Figures** section (proposed from field experience by
  a downstream adopter): every figure is derive-on-demand (store the
  procedure, not the value), stored-with-recipe (value + recipe + date — the
  recipe makes a lone figure falsifiable), or a frozen dated measurement
  (superseded explicitly by a new measurement, never silently "corrected").
  Reconcile (protocol and wiki-compact skill) now recomputes recipe-bearing
  figures — a mismatch is a conflict with the source of truth even when no
  competing claim exists. "Stale = conflicting, NOT old" is unchanged: age is
  still not a signal; recomputability is a detection mode for conflict.
- **Outward address repair** — the one permitted edit on a history page
  (ruled on a live downstream case): when archive-page frame prose points at a live
  artifact whose address went stale (moved/renamed/re-keyed, including an
  alias that still resolves on click but fails search), append a dated route
  to the SAME artifact beside the original text. Additive only — never delete
  or reword the original, never re-aim at a different artifact; claims stay
  frozen. Logged as `ingest`. In PROTOCOL.md and the wiki-compact skill, in
  parity.

### Changed

- CONFORMANCE ruling 1 wording amended to match intended (and reference)
  behavior: a line terminates at LF **or at end-of-input**, and one CR
  immediately preceding the terminator is stripped — so a final unterminated
  line ending in a bare CR does not count that CR toward the subject length.
  The read layer is explicitly inside the contract.
- Changelog version headers no longer carry dates or "unreleased" markers:
  merge-is-release means the date is unknowable before landing and stale
  after slipping (0.2.8 shipped reading "unreleased"). Per this release's own
  Figures rule, the date is derive-on-demand — the header comment states the
  git derivation.

## 0.2.8

Linter behavior release: aligns `wiki_lint.py` with the new `CONFORMANCE.md`
contract written for the ports of the linter to other languages. Some wikis
that passed under 0.2.7 will fail under 0.2.8 — the new failures are listed
first.

### Upgrade impact — new ERRORs you may see

- **`nested-pages`** (new check): any `.md` file in a subdirectory of
  `.claude/wiki/` is now an ERROR. Previously a nested wiki was silently
  half-inspected (nested pages skipped entirely) while reporting misleading
  errors. The standard is flat by design; fix by prefix-flattening
  (`bugs/foo.md` → `bugs-foo.md`) with the index table carrying the grouping.
- **`index-target-not-bare`** (new check): a local `.md` link target in
  `index.md` that contains `/` is now an ERROR. Previously such targets were
  silently discarded and validated by nothing.
- **Unicode digits in log dates are now rejected.** `## [YYYY-MM-DD] ...`
  requires ASCII `[0-9]`; a date written with e.g. Arabic-Indic digits
  previously passed by accident (Python's Unicode `\d`) and now fails as
  `log-body`.

### Fixed — false errors removed

- Linking to `log-archive.md` from any page no longer reports a false
  `broken-wiki-link`; an `index.md` link to `log.md` or `log-archive.md` no
  longer reports a false `dangling-index-entry`. These files are
  infrastructure: always valid link targets, never page declarations.
- A form feed (or other non-LF control character) inside a log subject no
  longer rejects the log. Lines terminate at LF (CRLF tolerated); other
  control characters have no structural meaning.

### Added

- `CONFORMANCE.md` — the linter's behavior contract for ports (Go/Node in
  progress), including the in-spec/out-of-spec matching rules.
- `wiki-lint` skill: the Tier 2 checklist gains the contradiction check
  (within-page and cross-page), delegating to the `wiki-compact` reconcile
  procedure — `PROTOCOL.md` listed it but the skill omitted it.
- `PROTOCOL.md`: a completed Tier 2 sweep records itself as a `query` log
  line, so "when was this wiki last swept" has a positive answer; findings
  whose fix is deferred route to the team's work tracker, not the wiki.
- `PROTOCOL.md` page format: write illustrative example paths with
  `<placeholder>` segments — a realistic-looking fake path fires
  `dead-code-ref` from the very page that uses it as an example.

### Changed

- Log-entry grammar is ASCII by design (`[0-9]` dates, `[a-z]` ops). A
  non-lowercase op (e.g. `Ingest`) now fails as `log-body` instead of
  `log-op` — still an ERROR either way.
- Documented (no Python behavior change): the 80-char `log-subject` limit is
  measured in Unicode code points, not bytes.

## 0.2.7

Initial public release.
